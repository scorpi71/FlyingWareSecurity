About
LUL is a Twitch emote featuring a picture of video game reviewer John Bain, better known by his online handle TotalBiscuit. The emote is typically used to indicate laughter in a similar vein to typing abbreviation LOL.

Origin
In 2013, Twitter user @itsjustatank photographed Bain laughing at an unknown event (shown below). In 2014, Bain began using the picture as an emote for subscribers of his Twitch channel with the keyword "cynicallaugh."

Spread
In July 2014, Bain received a DMCA takedown by the photographer for unauthorized use of the picture, due to Bain providing it as a subscription perk.



My apologies, but the cynicalLaugh emote is temporarily unavailable due to a DMCA from the photographer. He is within his rights to do this, although as always I disapprove when people use this system without first attempting to resolve the issue by contacting the person they have a problem with. We will be replacing the emote shortly with one from another source/taking a similar picture ourselves, whichever turns out to have the better result.

On July 9th, Redditor Ed_Cock submitted a post to /r/CynicalBrit[3] featuring "visually similar images" from Google Image search to replace the emote (shown below).

In 2016, the emote was added to the BetterTTV Twitch extension.[2] On September 1st, 2017, the emote was officially implemented as a global Twitch.tv emote, making it visible to anyone using the service. That day, Bain tweeted that the emote was altered from the original to avoid copyright issues (shown below).[4]
